  - A simple counter mechanism that keeps track of how many times an address has hit the `count` method

- Create a subgraph for the above contract

- Create a simple react app that displays all the addresses and their current count using the subgraph as the source of data

- deploy the subgraph and react app to a hosting platform of your choice
